# True Xenotypes
 
The main goal of this mod is to adjust pawn xenotypes after changing genes. Since the vanilla game calmly allows the existence of baseliners with a bunch of both xenogenes and endogenes, which somewhat contradicts the description.

## Features
- Updating the xenotype after changing genes. The pawn xenotype will be adjusted relative to the genes, to the most similar. This only affects if the xenotype remains a baseliner after implantation.
- Adjusting the genes of children. Forced addition of endogenes of parents, regardless of their complexity. As a bonus, inheritance of archite genes, provided that both parents have these genes.
- Generation of xenotypes from custom xenotypes. Allows you to save a copy of the genes of a custom xenotype, so that later when you start the game, the game generates a full-fledged xenotype based on it.

Each of the features is presented as options and can be enabled/disabled in the settings.

# Warning
The mod is experimental. Although it was made with a focus on minimal impact on performance, it may behave strangely with mods. It was tested on most vanilla mechanics, including implantation, pregnancy, duplication and other similar ones.
